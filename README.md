FTDI ESP8266 Definitive Wiring  By RuiMonteiro https://www.instructables.com/FTDI-ESP8266-Definitive-Wiring/
I added a select jumper to be able to upgrade the ESP-01 firmware and a jumper to plug a led on GPIO2 for testing.
I also beefed up the traces and added via's to do one sided engraving , using the vias to put jumper wires.

Eagle Cad and Kicad files added.

The Kicad files, I was also able to beef up all the pin traces to allow to be big as possable  to help with doing engraving the boards and easier soldering.

Found my first issue, traces touching. I corrected the kicad files and reuploaded.

Manually ran Mill and fixed Touching Traces, Saved the board.

Oh well all had to be redone. when I went to plug in programer the pins were reversed. Corrected Eagle and Kicad files. Complete rearange to get most traces on bottom for single side work. red traces will we jumper wires.

Eagle Cad

KiCad  It is where I am able to enlarge via's and foot print holes.
