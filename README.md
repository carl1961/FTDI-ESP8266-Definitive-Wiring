FTDI ESP8266 Definitive Wiring  By RuiMonteiro https://www.instructables.com/FTDI-ESP8266-Definitive-Wiring/
I added a select jumper to be able to upgrade the ESP-01 firmware and a jumper to plug a led on GPIO2 for testing.
I also beefed up the traces and added via's to do one sided engraving , using the vias to put jumper wires.

The Kicad files, I was also able to beef up all the pin traces to allow to be big as possable  to help with doing engraving the boards and easier soldering. 
will update as I progress
